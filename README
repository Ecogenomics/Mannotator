Mannotator
------------------------------------------------

Behold! The Mannotator walks among us!

------------------------------------------------
What is it?
------------------------------------------------

With such an exciting name, you may be forgiven for thinking that the mannotator is something other than a microbial sequence annotator, BUT, you'd be wrong… If you have a microbial assembly, then you can use this tool to annotate your contigs. This tool is not perfect, nor complete. Any and all suggestions are welcome!

"Annotate your contig" (currently) means:
* Call open reading frames (ORFs) on your contigs or complete genome using a consensus approach (e.g. RAST, Prodigal, others possible)
* Assign function (KEGG, COG/NOG, eggNOG, Gene Ontology (GO)) to these ORFs using a best blast hit approach


------------------------------------------------
What to do before I can use it?
------------------------------------------------

Step 1: Install Mannotator's dependencies. You'll need Perl and the following Perl modules:
   * Bioperl
   * Getopt::Euclid
   * URI::Escape

Step 2: Prepare database files to run your annotations with. Mannotator has support for EMBL Uniref/COG/KEGG and NCBI Nr/Taxonomy

Step 2a: Download your protein database of choice, i.e. Uniref90 (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/uniprot/database/download.html) or Nr (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/../blast/db/FASTA/nr.gz)

Step 2b: Uncompress it and format it with the BLAST formatdb utility

Step 2b: Use Mannotator's idMergeUniref.pl or idMergeNr.pl to produce a file of ID mappings, i.e. Uniref_mappings.txt or Nr_mappings.txt

Now you are ready to annotate your sequence using Ze Mannotator

------------------------------------------------
How do I use it?
------------------------------------------------

NOTE: These instructions are made for the install on our Eury server. They can easily be modified to work elsewhere though…

Step 1: Ensure all you contig names (fasta IDs) are computer friendly. Avoid the following characters in fasta headers (always a good idea anyway…). Also, make sure that all the fasta headers are unique!

Avoid these characters:

| 
space
\
&
*
(
)
&

Step 2. Submit your sequences for annotation on the RAST server at http://rast.nmpdr.org/. When it is over, export your annotations as a GFF file. The RAST annotation may last several days, so in the meantime, start step 3.

Step 3. Find ORFs in your sequences using Prodigal (on eury)

$ prodigal -i IN_FILE -o OUT_FILE.gff3 -f gff

For metagenomic contigs, try:

$ prodigal -i IN_FILE -o OUT_FILE.gff3 -f gff -p meta

Step 4. Copy the Prodigal and RAST gff3 files and the multiple fasta file containing your contigs into a working directory.

Step 5. Unleash the mannotator!

The pipeline consists of one data file, two perl scripts which do the work and one “outer” script which ties them together. Here is a quick rundown what is being done by the mannotator and how to run it. Read below to learn about what the scripts are doing.

   1.
      Combine multiple gff3 files into one and extract fasta sequences of un-annotated ORFs
   2.
      Use Blastx against the Uniref90 or Nr databases to get best similarity for each each ORF fasta sequence
   3.
      Use the Uniref obtained in the previous step to assign KEGG and COG/NOG IDs to each of the un-annotated fasta files. If you used Nr, then you get GI (genbank identifiers) which are used to look up the putative function and taxonomy of the proteic sequence.
   4.
      Mix all the information together and return a single gff3 file called 'mannotatored.gff3' that contains all your annotations. You can visualise the annotations contained in this file using Artemis or GBrowse.

Running the Mannotator will take a while, so perhaps you should use nohup or screen. The order of the GFF files is IMPORTANT. You should put the RAST file first, followed by the prodigal file.

$ mannotator.pl -gffs rast.gff3 prodigal.gff3 -contigs contigs.fa -protdb uniref -seq_embed

$ mannotator.pl -gffs rast.gff3 prodigal.gff3 -contigs contigs.fa -protdb nr -i2a Nr_mappings.txt -seq_embed

If you ran your data against both Uniref (for function assignment) and Nr (for taxonomy assignment), you might want to recombine your GFF output files into a single file using the combineGffAnnotations.pl script.


Where the uniref file can be found (on Eury) at:

/Volumes/Biodata/BLAST_databases/UniProt/UniRef90/uniref90.fasta

And the u2a file is at:

/Volumes/Biodata/ANN_mappings/ANN_mappings.txt

The pipeline will output a file called “mannotatored.gff3”

FIN

------------------------------------------------
More info on the scripts themselves
------------------------------------------------

The first is called combineGffOrfs.pl. It will take any number of gff3 files and merge their ORFs into one combined file. Also, it is currently programmed to extract the fasta sequences for ORFs which have not been given a RAST/FIG annotation. This script will run as a stand alone application. The order of the gff3 files is IMPORTANT. You need to supply them in the order in which you trust them.

$ combineGffOrfs.pl -gffs|g gff_file1[,gff_file2[, ... ]] -contigs|c contigs_file

The second script is called blast2Ann.pl. It will take a Uniref90 blastx result and add KEGG and COG/NOG annotations to your contigs. Again, it can be run as a standalone.

$ blast2ann.pl -u2a|u ANN_file -gff3|g gff3_file

The ANN_file is a special text file which links Uniref90 IDs to KEGG and COG/NOG IDs. You can find a version of this file on Eury at:

/Volumes/Biodata/ANN_mappings/ANN_mappings.txt

You can update this file with newer annotations by running the script idMergeUniref.pl, also found in the mannotator directory on Eury.

The format of the ANN_mappings file is as follows:

UniProtID^[;Ontology_term=COG_ID:COG-NOGID[;Ontology_term=COG_DESC:COG-NOG text description]][;Ontology_term=KEGG_ID:KEGG entryID[;Ontology_term=KEG_PATHWAY:KEGG pathway ID][;Ontology_term=KEGG_ONTOLOGY:KEGG ko ID]]
